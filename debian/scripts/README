BusyBox Debian packaging Howto for Maemo
========================================

This is a howto for creating optimal match between BusyBox
Debian package configuration and the upstream Debian packages
which BusyBox replaces.

Files:

- README -- this file
- create-control.py -- script to create BusyBox packaging files
- check-links.py -- script for checking at package build whether
                    the packaging files match BusyBox created link list
- debian-mappings.txt -- mappings between BusyBox and Debian packages,
                         needed by the script
- busybox-notes.txt -- some extra notes about Debian vs. (Maemo)
                       BusyBox differences
- *.dirs -- extra packaging files needed in addition to ones
            created by the script


What updates are needed and when/where:

When Packaging info needs to be changed (maintainer etc):
-> Updating control file content excerpts in the beginning
   of create-control.py

When whole Maemo syncs to newer upstream Debian version (every 3 years?):
-> Updating debian-mappings.txt according to changes in Debian (if any)

When BusyBox configuration needs to be changed (after corresponding
architecture ticket is accepted):
-> Iterate through the steps below.  Replace the earlier package
   control, *.links, *.postinst and *.prerm files with ones created
   by create-control.py


BusyBox configuration update steps:

1. Enable/disable relevant things from BusyBox config
	vi debian/config/config.maemo

2. Create initial control, postinst & links files for BusyBox
   packages based on this config file:
	cd debian/scripts
	./create-control.py -c ../config/config.maemo debian-mappings.txt

3. If any errors were reported, add the missing BB binaries
   to Debian mappings and repeat from 1).  May be needed if later
   (>1.11) BusyBox versions have new binaries that are enabled

4. Build BusyBox:
	cd ../..
	dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -b -uc

5. Create updated control, postinst & links files for BusyBox
   packages based on the BusyBox links file:
	cd debian/scripts
	./create-control.py -l ../build/build_maemo/busybox.links debian-mappings.txt

6. Update BusyBox config (or mappings file) to fix the relevant
   issues and repeat from 4) until no relevant warnings are given

7. Overwrite previous packagaging with the new one:
	cp *.dirs ../; mv control *.{links,postinst,prerm} ../

8. Cross-check from debian/rules file that everything is up to date.
   Manually you can do it like this:
	cd ..
	scripts/check-links.py build/build_maemo/busybox.links *.links

NOTE: The script cannot deduce all the symlinks based on BusyBox
configuration at step 2), that's why BB config is used only for
initial configuration and rest of the checks at step 5) are done
based on the links file created by the BusyBox build.
