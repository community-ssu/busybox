Changes between Diablo and Fremantle Maemo BusyBox configurations
-----------------------------------------------------------------

- sysvinit: in Diablo, real package, in Fremantle, provided by BB
  - In Fremantle "/sbin/init" comes from "upstart", not sysvinit though
  - Note: In Debian Lenny sysvinit was split to sysvinit & sysvinit-tools
    and the debian-mapping.txt follows that.  Diablo sysvinit still
    contains binaries for both of these packages like Debian Etch did
- module-init-tools: in Diablo, provided by BB, in Fremantle, real package


Comparison between Maemo BusyBox symlinks and Debian (Etch-Sid) binaries
========================================================================

Two ways for listing applets:
- ./busybox|grep -A99 addgroup|tr ',' '\n'|awk '/[^ ]/{print $1}'|sort
- make busybox.links
  python -c "import os;\
  print ''.join([os.path.basename(x) for x in open('busybox.links')])"


Name conflicts
--------------

pscan: BusyBox binary scans ports, Debian C-source
ftpput: BusyBox binary has regular FTP, Debian camera additions


Renames/replacements
--------------------

It doesn't make sense to rename these to use same
name as Debian alternative before somebody checks
that they're compatible enough with the Debian ones.

Debian:   BusyBox:
lzcat     -> lzmacat
makedev   -> makedevs
udev      -> mdev
microcom  -> minicom
splash    -> fbsplash
cron      -> crond
dhttpd    -> httpd
in.tftpd  -> tftpd
cat -v    -> catv
ip addr   -> ipaddr
ip link   -> iplink
ip route  -> iproute
ip tunnel -> iptunnel
ip rule   -> iprule

For some reason, in Debian 'dnsd' is in (dietlibc)-dev package
and located in /usr/lib/diet/bin/dnsd.


Extras
------

[[ -> symlink to [


Special cases
